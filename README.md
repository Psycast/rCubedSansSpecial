# rCubedSansSpecial
Special April Fools 2020 Event Codebase

This acts as a time-capsule of the FFR rCubed engine codebase for the Sans Battle event and it's game logic. 
It wasn't included in the public release of the engine code due to it's nature.

Compiled builds of the event engine can be found in the "builds/" folder or on the releases page and contains 
two seperate builds that will run differently depending on your computer hardware.

These are slightly modified from the time of release to remove the in-game updater and allow the battle level mods
to work on any level.
